Double Click the JarFile to start program. This does not work in console

Each RadioButton represents the sorting algorithm to be used on the unsorted list below. 

Clicking new random SSN will change the unsorted list below to a new list. It will also rewrite the text file. 

Text files will be placed in the folder the Jar is in. It is not recommended to put this onto the desktop as it will create 4 text files of clutter.
